## Compact Rules (injected into sub-agents)

### TypeScript & Code Conventions
- Strict TypeScript — never `any`, avoid `as` (only for Payload response casts)
- No barrel files (`index.ts` re-exports)
- No comments in code
- kebab-case file names
- English for all identifiers

### Architecture (3-layer mandatory)
- Client Component → `useAction(action)` → never call actions directly
- Action (`src/components/[feature]/actions.ts`): `actionClient` + `getCurrentUser()` + role check + schema from `@/schemas/`
- Service (`src/app/services/[entity].ts`): Payload DB only, `overrideAccess: true`, receives `ownerId`
- Schema (`src/schemas/[feature]/[name]-schema.ts`): Zod, `required_error` + `invalid_type_error` on all fields, `.trim()` + `.max()` on strings, messages in Spanish

### Rendering
- Server Components by default; `"use client"` only for state/events/browser APIs
- Componentize: separate server vs client logic in different files

### UI
- shadcn/ui only — install via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Lucide React for icons — no SVGs inline
- `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- Tailwind CSS 4.x, mobile-first

### Forms
- Full shadcn Form stack: `<Form>`, `<FormField>`, `<FormItem>`, `<FormLabel>`, `<FormControl>`, `<FormMessage>`
- `useForm` + `zodResolver` + submit via `executeAsync`

### Payload CMS
- Types from `src/payload-types.ts` — auto-generated, never edit
- Run `pnpm generate:types` after any collection change
- All `@payloadcms/*` pinned to `3.75.0` (no `^`)
- In hooks, always pass `req` to nested operations for transaction atomicity
- `overrideAccess: false` when applying real access control; `true` in services

### Quality Gates
- `tsc --noEmit` — must pass before shipping
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint + next lint
- No `console.log` in production code
